Features Implemented:

	1. Bubbles are subject to gravity, and thus follow a parabolic path. Also implemented bouncing in Y direction.
	2. Collision between the bullet and a bubble causes both to disappear.
	3. Collision between the shooter and a bubble causes the game to end with a 'game over' message.

	4. Introduced bigger bubbles which split into smaller bubbles on being hit by a bullet.
	5. Introduced levels, bubble speeds increase in the x direction with every level.
